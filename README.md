# House-Prices-Prediction
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". It includes 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

# Project Description
In this project, we aim to predict the sale prices of houses using various features such as their size, location, and number of rooms. The dataset includes missing values and some incorrectly formatted data, which will allow us to demonstrate advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. We will build and evaluate a **Random Forest Regressor** model to make accurate price predictions.
